# Cube3D
Cube made in 3D with python Rihno7

Hello everybody,

Today I am really happy to show my first 3D object with Rhino7. It looks like a building with small rooms. I made this project with the Michigan University's lesson. I made this cube with the rhinoscriptsyntax module. I want to apologize if I publish only 1 or 2 projects per month, that's because my course takes me a lot of time. I will probably publish other projects, because I really like Rhino and the 3D is very new for me. I work on Windows 10 with the last version of Rhino. Don't hesitate to check the images that I uploaded and also my code. Even if you don't know the rhinoscriptsyntax module, you can understand the code easily.

Goodbye !!
